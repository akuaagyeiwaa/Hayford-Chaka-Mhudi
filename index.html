      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p> Akua Agyeiwaa Denkyi-Manieson is a doctoral student from Ghana, West Africa. Akua specializes in Literary and cultural studies at the Department of English, University of Nebraska, Lincoln. 
           Akua specializes in colonial African novels. Archiving African digital sources is of great interest to Akua, and she hopes to archive African literary texts. Two pictures, one taken at Bridgeport Beach and the other taken at the Egyptian pyramid, influence my world view and they are shared below.Enjoy! </p>


    <h3>Bridgeport Beach</h3>

        <p class="two"> @ Bridge port Beach, Connecticut, USA, 2019. The path by my image is symbolic of my life’s journeys, through Teacher Training College and working as a teacher before embarking on the university as my classmates had done. Between my first and second degrees was a gap of two years that I used teaching at both Kumasi Wesley Girls’ Senior High school and Ghanatta Senior High school between 2004 and 2006. After my second degree and settling into marriage, I spent a decade teaching at Central University, Accra, Ghana.  In 2022, I found myself at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA. Indeed a journey of a thousand miles always begins with a step. I am still on the road of life, and I pray every day that I will have a safe landing, so help me God!</p>

        <p>My angle positioning taken at the foot of the infamous pyramid of Egypt, holds an emotional connotation. This positioning symbolizes my movement towards success, achievement and all that I hold dear. 
           Like the peak of the pyramid, I aspire to reach the very top of my chosen career. When I'm tired,  I will rest, I may slow down along the way BUT NEVER GIVE UP!</p>
