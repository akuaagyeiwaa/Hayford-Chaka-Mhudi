      <h4>About me</h4>

      <p>This is a work is part of a Digital humanities project that aims at archiving liteary sources in various forms. In this work, we shall review three texts from West African, South and Central Africa. Various sources are used in analysing the identified themes. It is hoped that his project will add to the discourse on archiving African literatureThis website explores the intersection between religion, colonization and the identity of the colonial citizens as represented in texts from the Gold Coast, now Ghana, South Africa, Lesotho and Nigeria. These texts include three novels: Casely Hayford’s (1911) Ethiopia Unbound, Solomon Plaatje’s (1930) Mhudi and Thomas Mofolo’s (1931) Chaka. Aside the novels, the project features recovered texts from Samuel Ajayi Crowther (1866, 1867), Bye Weah (24 January 1876, 7 March 1876), James MacQueen, Saeid Lief Ben; Thomas Wogga (1845) and Frederick Douglass, (9 May 1846). Also included in the discussion are scholarly periodicals from Samuel Johnson (1875), John Philips (1823) and Aga Salim (1853), all retrieved from one more voice. 
The project on this website is a unique resource because of the three-dimensional analysis involving novels, recovered texts and periodicals. Often, research of these critical areas in African studies focuses on a single genre plus critical text to draw a conclusion. However, in this work, we base our analysis on novels, recovered scholarly texts and periodicals. That way, the results and conclusions would represent a holistic approach, which is the import of the epigraph. The in-depth analyses of the intersectionality between religion, colonization and identity fills a crucial gap in African studies. This website would be an invaluable resource for anyone interested in the above themes.
