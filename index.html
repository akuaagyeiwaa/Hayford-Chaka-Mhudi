        <h1>The first was taken at Bridge port Beach, Connecticut, USA, in 2019. This shows the length of my life’s journeys, through Teacher Training College and working as a teacher before embarking on the university as my classmates had done. Between my first and second degrees was a gap of two years that I used teaching at both Kumasi Wesley Girls’ Senior High school and Ghanatta Senior High school between 2004 and 2006. Then after my second degree and settling into marriage, I spent a decade teaching at Central University, Accra, Ghana.  In 2018, I began a PhD at the University of Ghana, only to truncate it afterwards, and now in 2022, I found myself at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, USA. This really is symbolic of my life’s journey, indeed a journey of a thousand miles always begins with a step. I am still on the road of life, and I pray every day that I will have a safe landing, so help me God! .</h1>

My angle positioning taken at the foot of the pyramid of Egypt holds an emotional representation towards my movement towards success, achievement and all that I hold dear. Like the peak of the pyramid, I aspire to reach the very top of my chosen career. When I tire, I will rest, I may slow down along the way BUT NEVER GIVE UP!
