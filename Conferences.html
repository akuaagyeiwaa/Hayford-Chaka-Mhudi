     <h2>Religion</h2>
                                                                    
  <img src="Ethiopia Unbound.jpg" alt="Casely Hayford's Ethiopia Unbound" height="250" width="250">                                                                   
 <p> We begin with the analysis of Casely Hayford’s<i> Ethiopia Unbound</i>. In the text, Casely Hayford painstakingly asserts the place of African traditional religion in the face of Christianity. He uses various analogies to reiterate the Akan belief in God. The author illustrates the imposing nature of colonialism in Christianity as an agency to impose other belief systems (Christianity and Islam) among African people.  
 A second text for our assessment of religion is [John] Philip, Edward Edwards’ “Africa. Character of Africaner”. The interactions between Livingstone and Africaner in the text bring to the fore various religious dimensions that are worth our analysis.  
A final text that dwells on the place of religion is Samuel Johnson et al. (1875). 2022. “Sick and Dying Christians in Yoruba”. In this work, Johnson brings out the inner conflict and difficulties that Christian converts faced as they sought traditional or orthodox medicine for various illnesses. 
The critical texts to be used for the religious analysis of the above texts are first, John Mbiti’s (1969) <i>African Religions and Philosophy</i>. This work explores various dimensions of African traditional religion. The book focuses on the traditional African religion’s beliefs, practices and values. 
Asonzeh Ukah(2013), Power, politics and Pentecostal in Yorubaland, analyses the growth of Pentecostalism in Yorubaland and its impact on Yoruba culture and society. 
 A final critical text for analyzing the theme of religion is Emmanuel Ayankanmi Ayandele’s (1992)<i>Christianity, Islam and African Traditional Religion in Nigeria: conflict, Accommodation, or Encounters</i>. This book is a collection of critical essays examining the relationship between Christianity, Islam, and African traditional religion in Nigeria and the Yoruba region.</p> 

   
        
        <h2>Colonialism</h2>
 
   
      <img src="mhudi.jpg" alt="Solomon Plaatje's mhudi" height="250" width="250">
  <p>The analysis of colonization shall focus on Solomon Plaatje’s Mhudi and Weah Bye’s “The Liberian War. To the Editor of the Times”. To begin, the setting of the Mhudi unveils the effect of Europeans coming to the African coast. The people most affected by the invasion of the colonizers are the BaRolong people, who face various forms of oppression and exploitation at the hands of the Europeans. These acts of the Europeans include their attempt to take over the land of the Barolong people, distract their socio-cultural lives and impose on the Barolong people the European culture and language. We must note that the Barolong people attempt fighting to resist these impositions in order to maintain their identity. 
Our second text, Weah Bye’s “‘The Liberian War. To the Editor of the Times”, is a narrative that recounts the presence of foreign nationals settled in Liberia, including Germans, French, English and  Americans. These individuals’ presence is due to colonial activities in the West African sub-region. The narrator’s statement: how could I venture to raise my puny arm against the British Government as to perpetrate.... such a black deed in murdering a British subject in defiance of British Power,” is pregnant with many revelations. The critical works to be used for this analysis are:
First, Frantz Fanon’s (2004) <i>The Wretched of the Earth </i> examines the Psychological and social impact of colonization on the colonized people and argues that decolonization must involve a radical transformation of society and the creation of new cultural and political-cultural institutions. 
    Second, Walter Rodney’s(1982)<i>How Europe Underdeveloped Africa</i>. This book is a detailed analysis of the impact of European colonization on African countries and argues that the exploitation of African resources and people was central to the development of Europe’s capitalist economy. 
Finally is Terence Ranger’s (1983) “The invention of Tradition Revisited: The case of colonial Africa. This text explores how colonial powers created and imposed new traditional and cultural practices on African societies and how these practices continue to shape African cultures and identities.</p>

                                                                                  
                                                                
    <h2>Identity and  Self-discovery</h2>
  
     <img src="chaka.jpg" alt="Thomas Mofolo's Chaka" height="300" width="300">
    <p>In Thomas Mofolo’s Chaka, identity and self-discovery is a theme worthy of our analysis. The novel tracks emperor Chaka’s life as he journeys through the various stages in life to the coming powerful king, Chaka the Zulu. Initially, he struggled to identify his place among his people until after his father’s death, when he was initiated into becoming the great king and taking over the rulership. These experiences eventually turn him into a powerful king who achieves exploits. Unfortunately, as he becomes powerful, his ambition leads to his downfall, and he is eventually killed by his kinsmen (half-brothers). The text also explores the life and journey of several other characters and how they each come to identify themselves. It must be reiterated that besides emperor Chaka the Zulu, the protagonist, other minor characters struggle with ideals of identity and self-discovery in the text. These include Unandi, Noliwe and Dingiswayo. Dingiswayo, Chaka’s mentor and foil, explores ways of ruling his people. Unlike Chaka, he employs diplomacy and alliance building; gradually, he fully understands his personality traits and leadership skills. Again, Noliwe, Chaka’s wife, struggles to accept society’s demands on her as wife and queen. As a result, she encounters many challenges with her husband, Chaka and in the process, comes to a full appreciation of herself and the demands made on her person. Finally, another character who struggles with identity and self-discovery is Unandi, Chaka’s mother. Initially a character and loving mother, as her son Chaka becomes increasingly powerful, Unandi, appalled by her son’s ambition, betrays him and orchestrates his downfall. Even though initially battles with her identity, she finally embraces her position as a marginalized woman in a man’s world. 
Besides Chaka, we shall use Samuel Ajayi et al. “Letter to Henry Venn; Letter to Samuel Ajayi Crowther”. Both letters by Samuel Ajayi Crowther unearth the place of colonization among African people. Through the first letter, we gain insight into how African society knowingly or unknowingly reinforced structures of colonization. Through the second letter, we are made to know about existing hierarchical structures and how existing ones were marginalized over newer ones. The sent letter to his son exposes Crowther’s ideals in meandering the ideals of colonization: empowerment of the agency of education. 
The last text for this work is Salim Aga’s “Africa considered in its social and political condition” though this text does not directly discuss identity in the broader sense of the word, it does highlight the impact of African cultural identity, and through this text, we are espoused to ways in which African societies navigate or negotiate their cultural identities in the face of colonization. The critical works to be used for this thematic analysis are: 
First, Frantz Fanon’s (2008) White Skins Black Masks. This text examines the psychological effects of colonialism and racism on the individual and argues that the struggle for self-discovery and identity is closely tied to the struggle for liberation. 
Second, Kwame Anthony Appiah’s (1992) African identity and the post-colonial Challenge explores the challenges of identity formation in post-colonial Africa. The text argues that a nuanced understanding of the continent’s diverse cultural traditions and histories is necessary for developing a cohesive African identity. 
Third is Mbembe Achille’s(2002) The Politics of selfhood examines how African individuals and communities navigate multiple and sometimes conflicting identities in an environment of rapid social and political change. 
Lastly, Obi Cyril’s (2003) Identity, Conflict, and Reconstruction in Africa. This paper contends that the relationship between identity, conflict and reconstruction in Africa can only be carried out by focusing on the locally-driven approach to conflict resolution and recovery is essential for sustainable peace and development.</p>
