     <h2>Religion</h2>
     <p> We begin with the analysis of Casely Hayford’s Ethiopia Unbound. In the text, Casely Hayford painstakingly asserts the place of African traditional religion in the face of Christianity. He uses various analogies to reiterate the Akan belief in God. The author illustrates the imposing nature of colonialism in Christianity as an agency to impose other belief systems (Christianity and Islam) among African people.  
 A second text for our assessment of religion is [John] Philip, Edward Edwards’ “Africa. Character of Africaner”. The interactions between Livingstone and Africaner in the text bring to the fore various religious dimensions that are worth our analysis.  
A final text that dwells on the place of religion is Samuel Johnson et al. (1875). 2022. “Sick and Dying Christians in Yoruba”. In this work, Johnson brings out the inner conflict and difficulties that Christian converts faced as they sought traditional or orthodox medicine for various illnesses. 
The critical texts to be used for the religious analysis of the above texts are first, John Mbiti’s (1969)  “African Religions and Philosophy”. This work explores various dimensions of African traditional religion. The book focuses on the traditional African religion’s beliefs, practices and values. 
Asonzeh Ukah(2013), Power, politics and Pentecostal in Yorubaland, analyses the growth of Pentecostalism in Yorubaland and its impact on Yoruba culture and society. 
 A final critical text for analyzing the theme of religion is Emmanuel Ayankanmi Ayandele’s (1992) Christianity, Islam and African Traditional Religion in Nigeria: conflict, Accommodation, or Encounters. This book is a collection of critical essays examining the relationship between Christianity, Islam, and African traditional religion in Nigeria and the Yoruba region.</p>
