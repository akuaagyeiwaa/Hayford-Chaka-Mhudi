     <h2>Religion</h2>
     <p> We begin with the analysis of Casely Hayford’s Ethiopia Unbound. In the text, Casely Hayford painstakingly asserts the place of African traditional religion in the face of Christianity. He uses various analogies to reiterate the Akan belief in God. The author illustrates the imposing nature of colonialism in Christianity as an agency to impose other belief systems (Christianity and Islam) among African people.  
 A second text for our assessment of religion is [John] Philip, Edward Edwards’ “Africa. Character of Africaner”. The interactions between Livingstone and Africaner in the text bring to the fore various religious dimensions that are worth our analysis.  
A final text that dwells on the place of religion is Samuel Johnson et al. (1875). 2022. “Sick and Dying Christians in Yoruba”. In this work, Johnson brings out the inner conflict and difficulties that Christian converts faced as they sought traditional or orthodox medicine for various illnesses. 
The critical texts to be used for the religious analysis of the above texts are first, John Mbiti’s (1969)  “African Religions and Philosophy”. This work explores various dimensions of African traditional religion. The book focuses on the traditional African religion’s beliefs, practices and values. 
Asonzeh Ukah(2013), Power, politics and Pentecostal in Yorubaland, analyses the growth of Pentecostalism in Yorubaland and its impact on Yoruba culture and society. 
 A final critical text for analyzing the theme of religion is Emmanuel Ayankanmi Ayandele’s (1992) Christianity, Islam and African Traditional Religion in Nigeria: conflict, Accommodation, or Encounters. This book is a collection of critical essays examining the relationship between Christianity, Islam, and African traditional religion in Nigeria and the Yoruba region.</p>

     <h2>Colonialism</h2>
  <p>The analysis of colonization shall focus on Solomon Plaatje’s Mhudi and Weah Bye’s “The Liberian War. To the Editor of the Times”. To begin, the setting of the Mhudi unveils the effect of Europeans coming to the African coast. The people most affected by the invasion of the colonizers are the BaRolong people, who face various forms of oppression and exploitation at the hands of the Europeans. These acts of the Europeans include their attempt to take over the land of the Barolong people, distract their socio-cultural lives and impose on the Barolong people the European culture and language. We must note that the Barolong people attempt fighting to resist these impositions in order to maintain their identity. 
Our second text, Weah Bye’s “‘The Liberian War. To the Editor of the Times”, is a narrative that recounts the presence of foreign nationals settled in Liberia, including Germans, French, English and  Americans. These individuals’ presence is due to colonial activities in the West African sub-region. The narrator’s statement: how could I venture to raise my puny arm against the British Government as to perpetrate.... such a black deed in murdering a British subject in defiance of British Power,” is pregnant with many revelations. The critical works to be used for this analysis are:
First, Frantz Fanon’s (2004) The Wretched of the Earth examines the Psychological and social impact of colonization on the colonized people and argues that decolonization must involve a radical transformation of society and the creation of new cultural and political-cultural institutions. 
Second, Walter Rodney’s(1982)How Europe Underdeveloped Africa. This book is a detailed analysis of the impact of European colonization on African countries and argues that the exploitation of African resources and people was central to the development of Europe’s capitalist economy. 
Finally is Terence Ranger’s (1983) “The invention of Tradition Revisited: The case of colonial Africa. This text explores how colonial powers created and imposed new traditional and cultural practices on African societies and how these practices continue to shape African cultures and identities.</p>
